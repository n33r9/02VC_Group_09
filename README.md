Assessing the effectiveness of ensemble learning algorithms.


## Datasets for evaluation:
- CIFAR100: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
- SMS spam collection:

- Heart disease dataset:

## Notes
Notes:
- Each research topic must implement the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
dataset preprocessing if necessary.
- Design and conduct experiments in accordance with the topic objectives.
- Evaluate computational and performance efficiency. The performance metrics
are task-specific, i.e.
    o Classification performance: F1, precision, recall, and accuracy.
    o Regression performance: mean squared error, mean absolute error, and
mean absolute percentage error.
    o Clustering performance: Dunn index and Sihouette coefficient; and
relevant metrics for downstream tasks.
- Summarize key findings from the experimental results.
- Prepare a comprehensive project report documenting the methodology,
experiments, and findings.
